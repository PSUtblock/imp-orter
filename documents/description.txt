This software is a companion launcher for GZDoom, a popular open-source project for the original Doom Series by iD.

- Importing tool to unzip mod files the user has downloaded and store them in a central location.
- Settings to define the directory paths to reference and run mods and GZDoom.
- 'Play' Launcher for users to select what mod to run and launch in GZDoom.

Prerequisites:
Users must have the most recent version of GZDoom on their machine. Along with GZDoom, original or shareware copies of
either Doom, or Doom II.
